# HappyNumbers

## Name
Project 1 - Happy Numbers

## Description
Write a program in different languages (Java, C, C#, Go, Perl, Python, Fortran, and Lisp) that takes two positive integer arguments and returns the base ten happy numbers between the two arguments sorted by by their norms in descending order. If there are more than ten happy numbers on the domain, return only the top ten happy numbers with the greatest norms; these should still be sorted descending order based on their norms.
